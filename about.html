          After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
          Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code
          reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

      <h4>How I stay commited to learning</h4>
      <p class="home-text">
        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
        and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
        learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
      </p>

      <h4>How I got started</h4>
      <p class="home-text">
        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
        take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
        use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
        summaries of what I learned using my own words.
      </p>

      <p class="home-text">
        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
        learning summaries was helping others learn and stay motivated.
