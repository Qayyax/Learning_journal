 ## About this project

 This project is one of scrimba's mini project after each module to make sure students get hands on practice on the concepts taught. 

 For this project, responsive design was tested, I usually struggle with responsive design before taking scrimba's course on responsive design. 

 I must say, I am so much confident now, I undertsnd when to use em, rem, % (relative units), and alo how to design mobile first. 

If you check my older repos, one of the main skill I really wanted to improve on was making mobile friendly and responsive sites, I am glad I was finally able to do that. 

## Skills I learnt

1. Responsive units rather than absolute units
2. CSS Grid [oh my days, I love it]
3. Design mobile first
4. Media query

## What I look forward to

I look forward to using frontend frameworks, and also getting more comfortable with JavaScript.
